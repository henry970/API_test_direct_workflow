# Integrate Postman with GitHub
learning.postman.com

Integrating Postman with GitHub enables you to synchronize your API collections, environments, and schemas, enhancing collaboration and version control. Here's how to set it up:

**1. Generate a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)**
To authenticate Postman with GitHub, you'll need a PAT:

Log in to your GitHub account.
Navigate to Settings > **Developer settings** > **Personal access tokens**.
Click on Generate new token, provide a name, and select the necessary scopes (ensure it has appropriate permissions).
Copy the generated token for use in Postman.

**Note:** For security, treat your PAT like a password and avoid sharing it.

2. Connect Postman to GitHub
With your PAT ready, integrate Postman with GitHub:

Open Postman and go to the Home page.
Select Integrations.
Search for GitHub and select it.
Click on Add Integration next to **Backup a Collection**.
Enter your GitHub Personal Access Token and authenticate.
Configure the integration by selecting the workspace, collection, repository, directory (optional), filename, and branch.
Click Add Integration to finalize the setup.
Postman will now automatically back up the specified collection to your GitHub repository, committing changes in JSON format whenever the collection is updated

**3. Sync API Definitions and Collections**
For seamless synchronization of API definitions and associated collections between Postman and GitHub:

In Postman, navigate to your API's page.
Under Connect repository, click Connect and select GitHub.

Follow the prompts to authenticate and select the repository and branch.
Once connected, you can push and pull changes between Postman and GitHub, ensuring both are in sync 


**4. Automate Testing with GitHub Actions**
To incorporate Postman tests into your GitHub Actions workflow:
Ensure your Postman collections and environments are synced with GitHub.
In your GitHub repository, set up a GitHub Actions workflow (e.g., .github/workflows/main.yml).
Configure the workflow to use the Postman CLI for running tests, referencing your collections and environments stored in the repository.
This setup allows for automated API testing as part of your continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipeline.

By integrating Postman with GitHub, you enhance collaboration, maintain version control, and streamline your API development and testing workflows.
